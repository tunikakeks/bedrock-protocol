# Generated Protocol Classes

This repository contains generated protocol classes for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.21.130 (protocol version 897).

## Notes

- Classes are generated using JavaPoet based on the official [protocol docs](https://github.com/Mojang/bedrock-protocol-docs)`.
- Each packet class implements the `IPacket` interface defined in this package.
- Lombok annotations (`@Getter`, `@Setter`) are used for boilerplate code reduction.
